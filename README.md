Linux resctrl selftest

Currently it supports MBM (Memory Bandwidth Monitoring), MBA (Memory Bandwidth Allocation), CQM (Cache QoS Monitoring), CAT (Cache Allocation Technology) tests on Intel RDT (Resource Director Technology) and AMD QoS.

It needs to run on resctrl enabled Linux kernel on platforms supporting Intel RDT or AMD QoS. Check REAME in the project on how to build and run the tests.
